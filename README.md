# **Combined Falls Dataset**

This project aims to create a fall detection system using wrist devices. The basis of this project is to combine 3 falls data sets to train and test a Machine Learning model to determine the occurrence of falls. The falls datasets are: **UP Fall**, **UMA Fall**, and **WEDA Fall**. The project was carried out following the following steps:

1. Data pre-processing.
2. Feature extraction.
3. Feature selection.
4. Data classification.

The document [Wrist-Based Fall Detection: Towards Generalization across Datasets](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/24/5/1679) explains how each of the steps is done.
